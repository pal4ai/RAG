# RAG
Retriever augmented generation demonstration for LLMs
### Dataset: 
This folder contains the 5 articles' dummy dataset that has been written after the GPT 3.5 was trained. This is to demonstrate the working of RAG pipelines for newer data that occurred after the LLM models had been trained. You can use any data source as long as the LLM being used was trained before the data was generated and should have no knowledge of it.

### Code:
LLM RAG pipeline-Part1.ipynb - Creates a basic RAG pipeline \
LLM RAG pipeline-Part2.ipynb - Enhances the above pipeline by adding citations to prevent hallucination and chat history to answer questions that have indirect references.

You can read detailed RAG and code explanation below in the 3 part articles: \
